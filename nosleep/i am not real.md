I'm not sure what is going on with me.

I like to think I'm a pretty normal guy. I study physics at my home town's university and live in a village about half an hour out of town
with my mother, who is a high-school teacher and on vacation right now. I don't go out much and spend way too much time on reddit.
We also have two cats, a 10-year-old shorthair and a long-haired foster kitten who's almost two years old. Anyway, on to the story.

Two days ago, while on my way home from university, I got hit by a speeding car while crossing the street.
The driver fled, but I didn't feel hurt; I got up and kept walking to the train station. Looking back, I don't
know why I brushed off that accident the way I did; I should've been more surprised at not being hurt. I took the train
and got home, and just went about my day.

Yesterday, I was playing with the younger cat and he scratched me. Now this is nothing unusual -- my hand and forearms
tend to have a few scratches on them at all times --, but this time it didn't really hurt. I felt the claws, and I saw them sink
into my skin, but when I looked at what should've been a surface wound I saw nothing, just smooth skin. I remembered the
accident I had the day before, and I was somewhat confused. Still, I didn't think much of it.

Today, a *third* incident occurred. My courses ended early, and I took an earlier train than usual. I called my mother
so she'd pick me up from the train station, which is a 25-minute walk from home. When I exited the car at home, I slammed
the door on my finger. Surprisingly enough, I didn't feel any pain, and my finger looked none the worse. There was no dent
or anything in the door, and I heard it close fully. That's when I was *really* creeped out.

A bit later, I went to my doctor and asked him to look at my leg, arm and finger. He found nothing unusual, and a quick
examination confirmed that they were completely uninjured. I told him what happened in the last two days and this morning;
he only looked at me like I'd just told him the sky had turned green. I said I was serious, and that I did remember those
things happening. Not wanting to be recommended a psychiatrist just yet, I left it at that, thanked him for his time and
went home again.

I've thought about what happened, and I've come up with these possible explanations:

 - My body is an android
 - I'm in a simulation, and the biophysics model bugged out on me
 - I'm hallucinating

I figured I might as well seek out the help of strangers on the internet, since there are certainly things I haven't thought
of yet. So can you help me figure out what's going on with me?
