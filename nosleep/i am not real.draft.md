# I am not real.

on my way home from uni

cross street

speeding car hits me

driver flees

yet I get up and go home anyway

---
## next day

my cat scratches me

no bleeding, not even red

2 in a row? odd

---
## 3rd day
slam car door on finger

feel nothing in particular

no dent in car door

no injury on finger

finger feels as solid as ever

but finger *does not* fit inside door slit, and door was fully closed

---

think: rule of 3, this is weird

## 4th day

go to doc

tell him this

he checks my legs, arm and finger

sees nothing unusual (no injury)

he thinks I'm bullshitting him

I express confusion

thank him for his time & leave, go home

---

think about possible causes

 - am I an android?
 - am I hallucinating?
 - is this a shitty simulation?
 - or something else?
