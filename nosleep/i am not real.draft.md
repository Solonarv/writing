# I am not real.

on my way home from uni

cross street

speeding car hits me

driver flees

yet I get up and go home anyway

---
## next day

my cat scratches me

no bleeding, not even red

2 in a row? odd

---
## 3rd day
slam car door on finger

feel nothing in particular

no dent in car door

no injury on finger

finger feels as solid as ever

but finger *does not* fit inside door slit, and door was fully closed

---

think: rule of 3, this is weird

## 4th day

go to doc

tell him this

he checks my legs, arm and finger

sees nothing unusual (no injury)

he thinks I'm bullshitting him

I express confusion

thank him for his time & leave, go home

---

think about possible causes

 - am I an android?
 - am I hallucinating?
 - is this a shitty simulation?
 - or something else?

WoG resolution: I am in a simulation, and it started glitching.

found out by:

thought a bit about the evidence I had, and possible theories.

Theories:
 
 - My body is actually robotic
 - I'm in a simulation
 - I'm dead / a ghost of some sort
 - I'm hallucinating or otherwise insane

 - Objects pass through my body instead of injuring me. inconsistent with the 'I'm an android' theory.
 - If it's a hallucination, it's a very consistent one. Consistent enoughthat I can't tell it apart form reality. ~= boltzmann brain hypothesis
 - I'm dead => I can still affect the world || redditors are also dead
 - Anything is possible in a simulation

Added evidence:
 - Went to doc again. Heartbeat, breathing, EEG etc are normal
 - Hair is cuttable, no idea if it still grows (this is only the 4th day, it *did* gro before)

checks I did:
 - no super strength (lifted stuff)
 - can't fly (jumped ~3m down, no spontaneuos flight; also can't lift off)
 
did some invuln. testing:

tried to hit self with hammer, knife, small axe: all passed through my legs, arms, abdomen

jumped out of window, then off roof : ~2.5m, ~6m resp. No injuries or pain (and I'm not good at jumping off things)
